# Welcome to Zach's react blog backend template.
This repo houses the MongoDB backend for a react blog-style template app.
To find the frontend template visit my repo here: https://github.com/Zach-Trani/react_blog_frontend_template


# Getting Started
Run the app locally using npm start.


# Development Overview - server.js file

A lightweight backend was developed in the server.js file to get the project up and running quickly. This can be further abstracted out to to an MVC architecture. 


The backend features a schema for new posts submitted by users. Also featured are controllers for each of the following scenarios:
* get all posts
* get one post
* create new post
* delete post
